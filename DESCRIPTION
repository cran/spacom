Description: The package provides tools to construct and exploit
        spatially weighted context data. Spatial weights are derived by
        a Kernel function from a user-defined matrix of distances
        between contextual units. Spatial weights can then be applied
        either to precise contextual measures or to aggregate estimates
        based on micro-level survey data, to compute spatially weighted
        context data. Available aggregation functions include
        indicators of central tendency, dispersion, or inter-group
        variability, and take into account survey design weights. The
        package further allows combining the resulting spatially
        weighted context data with individual-level predictor and
        outcome variables, for the purposes of multilevel modelling. An
        ad hoc stratified bootstrap resampling procedure generates
        robust point estimates for multilevel regression coefficients
        and model fit indicators, and computes confidence intervals
        adjusted for measurement dependency and measurement error of
        aggregate estimates. As an additional feature, residual and
        explained spatial dependency can be estimated for the tested
        models.
